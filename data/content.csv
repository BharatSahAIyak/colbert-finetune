0,8,"'5. Mealy bug , Brevennia rehi , Pseudococcidae, Hemiptera Symptom of attack: The infestation starts in plants one or two month after transplanting. Stunted, circular patches may be seen in the fields. If such plants are pulled out and teased the insects can be seen at the base of the leaves and leaf sheaths. Nature of damage: Large number of these insects’ remains inside the leaf sheaths and suck up the plant sap. The affected tillers remain stunted with yellowish curled leaves. When the attack is severe, it inhibits panicle emergence. This type of disease is called as Soorai disease in Tamil Nadu. The damage occurs from September. In severe cases, yield may be reduced even upto 50%. Egg: The female lays numerous yellowish white eggs/ simply deposits nymphs in outer leaf sheaths. Nymph: The newly hatched nymphs crowded within the waxy threads for 6-10 h before they disperse to various parts of the same plant. The pale yellowish nymph is active and crawls about the plant for a while and settled itself on the plant/ stem and turns dark yellow after a day.  Body gets covered with waxy material on second day. Adult: Nymphs and adults being wingless look alike. Females are reddish, oval, soft- bodied living in colonies inside the leaf sheath. Males are small, slender, pale-yellow, having single pair of wings and a style like process at the end of the abdomen but lack mouthparts.  Males are seldom found in the colonies, so it reproduces parthenogenetically.'"

They are visible only when the damage has been severe, the plants present a burnt up appearance, hopper burn, in circular patches. Nature of damage: Both the nymphs and adults remain at the ground level and suck the plant sap. It is a typical vascular feeder primarily sucking phloem sap leading to hopper burn . At early infestation, circular yellow patches appear which soon turn brownish due to the drying up of the plants. The patches of infestation then may spread out and cover the entire field. The grain setting is also affected to a great extent. During sustained feeding, it excretes a large amount of honeydew . It also acts as vector of the virus diseases like grassy stunt, wilted stunt and ragged stunt. (Transmission of persistent ragged stunt and grassy stunt virus require more time.

Nature of damage: The insect may start attacking the plants in the nursery especially long duration varieties. The incidence is mild in the season June to September, but later on gets intensified from October to January and February. The caterpillar enters the stem and feeds on the growing shoot. As a result the central shoot dries up and produces the characteristic dead heart . The tillers may get affected at different stages. When they are affected at the time of flowering the earheads become chaffy and are known as white ear . Egg: Eggs are creamy white, flattened, oval and scale like and laid in mass. Each egg mass consists of 15-80 eggs and covered with buff coloured hairs. Before hatching, the eggs darken to a purplish tinge. They are laid mostly near the tip of the leaves. Larva: The hatched larvae move downward and wander about on the plant for 1 or 2 hours. They may hang down by a sliver thread and get to other plants with the help of the wind. They can also swim over the water and reach other tillers. They enter the leaf sheath and feed upon the green tissues of the stem for 2-3 days. Then they bore into the stem near the node. Deposition of silica in the epidermal layer of the stem and leaf sheath acts as an obstacle to the first instar larvae to chew up a hole. Generally only one caterpillar is seen inside a tiller. It may come out and attack fresh tiller. The full-grown caterpillar measures about 20 mm, white or yellowish white in colour with a conspicuous prothoracic shield. Pupa: Pupation takes place inside the rice stem, straw or stubble. Before pupation it make a exit hole in the internode and covers it will a thin web for the adult to come out later. The anterior extremity of the cocoon is tubular and attached to the exit hole and to make the cocoon waterproof the larva webs two horizontal septa in this tubular area.

60,18,"'2. Rice case worm : Nymphula depunctalis : Pyraustidae: Lepidoptera Symptom of attack: Plants stunted, caterpillars hanging on the leaf edges in a tubular case . Nature of damage: The caterpillar cuts a piece of leaf, rolls it longitudinally into a tubular structure and remains inside. It feeds by scraping the green tissue of the leaf. The cases often float in the water. Its damage can be distinguished from damage by other pests in two ways, firstly the ladder like appearance of the removed leaf tissue resulting from the back and forth motion of the head during feeding and secondly the damage pattern is not uniform through out the field because the floating cases are often carried in the run off water to low lying fields where the damage is more concentrated. Egg: Eggs are light yellow, disc like, smooth and irregular in shape. They are laid on the under side of the leaves floating on the water. Larva: They hatch into green caterpillars with orange brownish head. Each caterpillar lives inside a tubular case and hang down the leaves. The tubular cases are open at one end. The inside of the case is lined with silk to hold a thin film of water, which is essential for respiration and preventing desiccation of the larvae. The cases are replaced with each moult. It moves up and down with the protruded legs and scrapes the green matter. It drops in the water when disturbed. It is semi aquatic and can breathe by filamental gills at the sides.

73,29,"'2. Stem borer : Chilo partellus : Crambidae: Lepidoptera Symptoms of attack: Presence of circular holes on the unfolded leaves and dead hearts in the early stages are the main symptoms. The boreholes may be visible in contrast to the dead heart caused by the stem borer. When grown up plants are attacked the symptoms will not be quite visible. Nature of damage: The caterpillar bores into the stem and feeds on the central shoot. There may be more than one caterpillar in a single plant. In early stages, the caterpillars make circular holes on unfolded leaves and later central shoot dries up producing dead heart. Later it acts as an internode borer and is found till the time of harvest. Young cobs may also be attacked. Yield is affected much and the quality of the fodder is also reduced. The damage caused to the crop by this pest was estimated to range between 70 – 80%. Egg: Eggs are yellowish in colour, flat and oval, laid on the underside of the leaves, near the midrib. Larva: The larva is pale white with black dots and brown head. The newly hatched caterpillars migrate to the top of the plant and enter the stem or it mines in the midrib or bores into the stem near the node and feeds upwards.

74,30,"'3. Pink Stem borer : Sesamia inferens : Noctuidae: Lepidoptera Symptom of damage: Presence of dead heart. Nature of damage: The young larvae after hatching, congregate inside the leaf whorls and feed on folded central leaves causing typical ‘pin hole’ symptoms. Severe feeding results in killing of the central shoot and consequent dead heart formation. Usually the second instar larvae migrate to neighbouring plants by coming out from the whorls and suspending themselves from the plants by silken threads, these are then easily blown off by wind to other plants. These larvae penetrate in the stem and cause tunneling resulting in stunting, infested plants become weak and bear very small earheads. The weakened stems, especially of tall local varieties, break easily during heavy rains or with high velocity winds. Egg: Creamy white spherical eggs are laid in batches in between leaf sheaths and stem of a plant. Larva: The larvae penetrate the stems directly and may kill the young plants. The fully developed caterpillar is cylindrical, pinkish dorsally and whitish ventrally.  Larvae can migrate from plant to plant. Pupa: Pupation occurs inside the stem, pupae are robust and light brown in colour. Adult: Adults are stout, straw coloured and are nocturnal in habit.'"

141,234,"'Normal atmospheric air contains about 78.08% of nitrogen (N2), 21% of oxygen (O2), 0.04% of carbon dioxide (CO2) and remaining other gases. A reduction in the concentration of O2 and/or an increase in CO2 concentration of the storage atmosphere surrounding fresh fruits and vegetables reduce the rate of respiration and also inhibits microbial and insect growth. The terms “controlled atmosphere” (CA) and “modified atmosphere” (MA) mean that the atmospheric composition surrounding a perishable product is different from that of normal air.  Both CA and MA commonly involve manipulation of CO2, O2 and N2 levels. The principle of CA or MA involves the complete or partial removal of air from the storage are and its replacement with a single gas or mixture of gases by either passive or active methods. Passive modification is a slow process. It requires reactions between the fruit or vegetable and its surrounding gases to take place, and the package to play the role of a regulator. On the contrary, active modification is faster and can be achieved by gas flushing, vacuum application or by using gas scavengers / emitters. Passive MA relies on the selective permeability of the packaging materials to different gases and on product respiration and is traditionally used with fresh and minimally processed fruits and vegetables. Gas-flush MA involves the establishment of a specific gas composition within the package in a single stage during the packaging operation, by flushing with the selected gas mixture before sealing. Depending on the desired residual O2, a vacuum operation may be needed prior to gas flushing. The gas mixture used is dependent on the type of fruit or vegetable. MA differs from CA only in how precisely gas partial pressures are controlled; CA is more precise than MA. When combined with chilling, CA or MA are increasingly important methods of maintaining high quality in processed foods during an extended shelf life.'"

Precooling may be done with cold air, cold water (hydrocooling), direct contact with ice, or by evaporation of water from the product under a partial vacuum (vacuum cooling). A combination of cooled air and water in the form of a mist called hyraircooling is an innovation in cooling of vegetables.'"
278,239,"'Air precooling- Precooling of fruits with cold air is the most common practice. It can be done in refrigerator cars, storage rooms, tunnels, or forced air-coolers (air is forced to pass through the container via baffles and pressure differences).'"
279,240,"'Icing- Ice is commonly added to boxes of produce by placing a layer of crushed ice directly on the top of the crop. An ice slurry can be applied in the following proportion: 60% finely crushed ice, 40% water, and 0.1% sodium chloride to lower the melting point. The water to ice ratio may vary from 1:1 to 1:4.'"
280,241,"'Room cooling- This method involves placing the crop in cold storage. The type of room used may vary, but generally consists of a refrigeration unit in which cold air is passed through a fan. The circulation may be such that air is blown across the top of the room and falls through the crop by convection. The main advantage is cost because no specific facility is required.'"
281,242,"'Forced air-cooling- The principle behind this type of precooling is to place the crop into a room where cold air is directed through the crop after flowing over various refrigerated metal coils or pipes. Forced air-cooling systems blow air at a high velocity leading to desiccation of the crop. To minimize this effect, various methods of humidifying the cooling air have been designed such as blowing the air through cold water sprays.'"
282,243,"'8 Hydrocooling- The transmission of heat from a solid to a liquid is faster than the transmission of heat from a solid to a gas. Therefore, cooling of crops with cooled water can occur quickly and results in zero loss of weight. To achieve high performance, the crop is submerged in cold water, which is constantly circulated through a heat exchanger. When crops are transported around the packhouse in water, the transport can incorporate a hydrocooler. This system has the advantage wherein the speed of the conveyer can be adjusted to the time required to cool the produce. Hydrocooling has a further advantage over other precooling methods in that it can help clean the produce. Chlorinated water can be used to avoid spoilage of the crop. Hydrocooling is commonly used for vegetables, such as asparagus, celery, sweet corn, radishes, and carrots, but it is seldom used for fruits.'"

289,244,"'Vacuum cooling- Cooling in this case is achieved with the latent heat of vaporization rather than conduction. At normal air pressure (760 mmHg) water will boil at 100°C. As air pressure is reduced so is the boiling point of water, and at 4.6 mmHg water boils at 0°C. For every 5 or 6°C reduction in temperature, under these conditions, the crop loses about 1% of its weight (Barger, 1961). This weight loss may be minimized by spraying the produce with water either before enclosing it in the vacuum chamber or towards the end of the vacuum cooling operation (hydrovacuum cooling). The speed and effectiveness of cooling is related to the ratio between the mass of the crop and its surface area. This method is particularly suitable for leaf crops such as lettuce. Crops like tomatoes having a relatively thick wax cuticle are not suitable for vacuum cooling.'"

296,249,"'It is difficult to coat steel plate uniformly with tin during the process of manufacture. Small microscopic spaces are always left uncoated, although the coating may appear perfect to the naked eye. The content of the can may react with the exposed parts of container and cause discolouration of the product or corrosion of the tin plate. When the corrosion is severe, the steel is attacked and black stains of iron sulphide are produced. Hence, it is necessary to coat the inside of the can with some material like lacquer, which would prevent discolouration, but would not impart its own flavor or injure the wholesomeness of the contents. The process of coating of inner side of the can to prevent discolouration of the product is called as lacquering. Lacquers include oleo-resinous material, synthetic resins, phenolic resins, epoxy resins and vinyl resins. There are two types of lacquers: (a) acid resistant and (b) sulphur resistant. The acid-resistant lacquer is ordinary gold coloured enamel and the cans treated with it are called as A.R-enamel cans. The sulphur-resistant lacquer is also of golden colour and the cans coated with it are called C-enamel cans or S.R. cans. Acid-resistant cans are used for packing of fruits of the acid group with soluble colouring matter such as raspberry, strawberry, red plum, coloured grapes, etc. Sulphurresistant cans are used for non-acid products like peas, corn, beans, etc.'"

Removal of the water (75-90%) present in fresh commodity results in reduction in the water activity and ultimately resistance against most of the deteriorative agents. The removal of water is carried out by the application of heat and this heat is usually supplied in the form of solar energy or artificially generated hot air. Removal of moisture and exposure of heat often results in poor textural attributes, loss in nutritive value (vitamins), discolouration and loss of flavouring components. Although both drying and dehydration are interchangeably used, drying is referred to removal of water to an equilibrium moisture content while dehydration is removal of water to an almost bone dry condition.

367,281,"'22 There are mainly two methods of preserving fruits and vegetables namely (i) by killing all the microorganisms responsible for spoilage, by heat or other means and then checking the entry of fresh microorganisms into the preserved product (ii) by making the conditions most unfavourable for the growth and multiplication of microorganisms. The first method is generally employed in the preservation of fruits and vegetables for making fruit juices, fruit powders, etc. and the second method in the preparation of pickles. The process of preservation of food in common salt or vinegar is called as pickling. Spices and edible oils also may be added to the product. Salt, vinegar, lactic acid and oil are the important ingredients used in pickle production. These substances when used in sufficient quantities, act as preservatives either singly or in combination. The preservative action of these substances are given below:'"
368,282,"'Salt Vegetables do not ferment when they are covered with strong brine or packed with a fairly large quantity of salt. Spoilage is prevented by adding sufficient common salt, bringing its final concentration in the material from 15 to 20 percent. At this high salt concentration, mould and even lactic acid-forming bacteria do not grow. This method of preservation is only applicable to vegetables which contain very little sugar because sufficient lactic acid cannot be formed by fermentation to act as preservative. Vinegar In vinegar pickles, vinegar acts as a preservative. In order to ensure satisfactory results, the final concentration of acid as acetic acid, in the finished product should not be less than 2 percent. To avoid dilution of the vinegar by the water liberated from the tissues, the vegetables are generally placed in strong vinegar of about 10 percent acidity for several days before final packing. This treatment also helps to expel the gases present in the intercellular spaces of the vegetable tissue. Lactic acid Bacteria prefer for their growth media with little or no acid. The lactic acid bacteria, however, can grow in acid media and can also produce acid through their action on the substrate. They can grow in the presence of 8 – 10 percent salt. The growth of undesirable organisms is inhibited by adding salt while allowing the lactic fermentation to proceed. In fermented pickles, microorganisms ferment sugars to lactic acid. When vegetables are placed in brine, the soluble material present in them diffuses into the salt water owing to osmosis and the liquid penetrates into the tissues. The soluble material, besides containing mineral matter, contains fermentable sugars. These sugars serve as food for lactic acid bacteria, which convert them into lactic and other volatile acids. Oil'"
369,283,"'23 In oil-based pickles, fruits or vegetables are completely immersed in the edible oil.

Sowing should be completed by mid-June to first week of July. 40 to 50 kg. per seed. at the rate of 20 cm. Sowing in rows should be done at a distance of.

The seed should be soaked in water for 24 hours and kept in a heap for 36-48 hours so that the seed begins to germinate. This germinated seed can be grown in the field at a rate of two cm. Sprinklers should be sown in standing water. In the Agra division, where wells are in spate and paddy seedlings may not be well prepared, it is better to adopt this method. This reduction is 30-40 kg. It is every day. Early ripening varieties like Saket-4, Prasad, Govinda, Manhar Pant-40, IR-36 etc. can be sown from the third week of June to the last week of July.

1207,1019,"'Kharif / Kharif Kharif / Rabi foodgrains in rainfed condition: Fertilizer content - kg. \'Hey. Nitrogen Phosphorus Potash 60 40 30 Method of application: Use the entire fertilizer at the time of sowing in the husk below the seed |नोट: Use green manure between the wheat and paddy crop in the continuous paddy-wheat areas or use 40-2 tonnes per hectare of cow dung manure in the paddy crop. Cultivation of moong in Zayed yields 45 kg of rice. Nitrogen is saved. Similarly, green manure (sunai or dhencha) yields about 40-60 kg. Nitrogen is saved. Therefore, use nitrogen fertilizers accordingly. If compost 40-42 is used, it also provides nutrients and improves the physical condition of the soil. It is especially beneficial to sow the structure to increase the organic matter in the fertile area. 2 quintals per hectare. Gypsum can be used as basal. This will meet the sulphur requirement of the paddy crop. Sulphur deficiency can also be overcome by the use of single super phosphate. Potash can be used in basal dressing but in light loamy soils it is advisable to use potash fertilizer in topdressing with urea. Therefore, half the amount of potash should be used at the time of transplanting in such land and the remaining half should be topdressed with nitrogen twice. It is advisable to give all the fertilizers at the time of transplanting in places where the paddy fields are waterlogged and have drainage facilities. If for some reason this is not possible, spraying a 2-3% solution of urea in such areas twice at the time of germination and at the initial stage of germination is beneficial. Before topdressing urea, water should be removed from the field and if this is not possible in an area, urea should be mixed with one-fourth cow dung manure in its double soil and kept for 24 hours. By doing this, urea is converted into ammonium carbonate and is not destroyed by seepage. 5. Water management: Despite the availability of irrigation potential in the state, only about 60-62% of the area under paddy is irrigated, while paddy crop, the food grain crop, requires the most water. The crop must be watered for a week after planting, at the time of hatching, germination, flowering, and grain filling. The flowering stage is very sensitive to water. On the basis of tests, it has been found that continuous watering is not necessary to take more yield of paddy, for this, 5-7 cm is required a day after the water disappears from the surface of the field. Irrigation is advisable. If water scarcity is seen due to lack of rainfall, then irrigation must be done. Water retention in the field increases the availability of phosphorus, iron, and manganese, and also results in less weed growth. It is also worth noting that 5 cm of water is lost when the stubble is released. It is also harmful to overwater a field for a long time. Therefore, it is very important to manage drainage in areas that are waterlogged, otherwise the yield will be adversely affected. If the field is continuously waterlogged in the irrigated condition, the water disappears from the field after a day, 5 to 7 cm. Watering until watered will also save irrigation water |5. 4 Seed treatment: Seed treatment must be done before planting the nursery. For this, where there is a problem of bacterial scorching or bacterial edema, 4 grams of Streptomycin Sulphate 90% + Tetracycline Hydrochloride 40% should be used per 25 kg.

Seeds should be considered ready for sowing in the nursery when they germinate. 7.5 Mat type nursery: 5-6 cm for growing paddy nursery. The topsoil of the field up to a depth of is collected by collecting the soil. It is finely pounded and sieved by sieving. The area where the nursery is to be put should be well paddled and then the farm water should be drained and allowed to remain for a day or two so that the surface becomes a thin layer. Now the area should be covered with 2 to 3 cm of soil by putting wooden planks of one meter width to the required length. Make high beds and place one cm of sieved soil prepared for nursery in this area. Lay it flat on a height and sprinkle sprouted seeds on it at the rate of 800 to 4000 grams per square meter. Now put a little sieved soil on it so that the seeds are covered. Then cover the nursery with straw grass and keep spraying water for 4-5 days. Do not use any fertilizer in the nursery. 5.8 Planting: 45 days for transplanting seedlings with the help of scraper (20-50 cm.

Method: Sow the seeds in a slightly backward direction or with a fertilizer drill at the proper soil moisture. It is preferable to sow by mulching. It should be kept in mind that after ploughing, there must be 400 to 500 crop plants per square metre, otherwise it will have a bad effect on the yield. To avoid delays, sow with Pantnagar xerotril seed and manure drill. Sowing by tractor-driven roto till drill is more profitable. In Bundelkhand (maar and kawar soils), sowing will be done without ploughing if the deposition is good. Sowing on Wheat Stem: With this technique, the field is prepared in the traditional way for sowing wheat and then wheat is sown by making a stump. In this method, a special type of machine (bed planter) is used for making a drain and sowing. The irrigation is done through the channels between the ridges and in the rainy season the drainage work is also done through these channels. Wheat is sown in 2 or 3 rows on a single ridge. By sowing wheat through this method, farmers can get a good yield by saving seed manure and water. In this method, we can take wheat crop as intercrop with sugarcane crop. This method requires the soil to be brittle for sowing and there should be enough moisture for good storage. The features and advantages of this technique are as follows: 4. About 25% of the seed can be saved in this method i.e. 30-32 kg. The seed is sufficient for one acre. This machine makes a 70 cm bed on which sowing is done in 2 or 3 rows. The seed depth should be 4 to 5 cm for good germination. 3. The beds should be in the north-south direction so that each plant gets equal amount of sunlight. 4. Wheat sown with this method saves 25 to 40 percent of water. If there is not enough moisture in the field, the first irrigation should be done within 5 days of sowing.

In sandy loam, rock and gravel sandy soil, 4 / 3 of the total amount of nitrogen, phosphate and potash should be given below the seed in the seedbed at the time of sowing. Half of the remaining nitrogen should be given after the first irrigation (20-25 day) (crown root stage) and the remaining amount after the second irrigation. In such soils, it is more beneficial to do so after top dressing irrigation where only 40 kg.

These are primarily developed to offer pleasure to consumers at affordable cost. The major group of synthetic beverages is soft drinks which contain flavoured sugar syrup as base material that may or may not be carbonated. The high potency sweetener based beverages also belong to the category of synthetic beverages as they contain artificial sweeteners mainly to reduce the calorific value.'
1419,1287,"'Carbonated beverages are the one where carbon dioxide is dissolved in syrup or water. The presence of carbon dioxide creates bubbles upon release of pressure and fizzing in the beverage.  The carbonated beverages are commonly referred as “Soft Drink”. Cola or lemonade beverages are typical examples of carbonated beverages.

1423,1289,"'a) Beer It is the world‟s third most consumed beverage. Beer is prepared by fermenting the “wort” (soluble liquid of barley malt digest) with appropriate yeast to attain an alcohol level in the range of 4-8 percent. Apart from alcohol, beer is also characterized by the “effervescence” i.e. foam which is produced by carbon dioxide and bitterness. The bitterness and aroma in beer is contributed by the hops ( Humulus lupulus ) solids as αiso-acids and other polyphenols.  There are many variants of beer but two are more popular. These are called as “Lager” beer which is fermented by bottom  yeast i.e. Saccharomyces pastorianus at lower temperature (7-12 O C) for longer period, while the “Ale” is manufactured by using top fermenting yeast i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae at relatively higher temperature (18-25 0 C) (Fig. 24.1). b) Wine'"
1424,1290,"'Wines are made from variety of fruits. Such as grapes, peach, plum or apricots. However, the most commonly used one is grapes, both green as well as red grapes. The grapes are macerated to release juice which is fermented naturally by wide range of yeasts including Saccharomyces spp., Pichia spp., Stellata spp . and certain lactic acid bacteria. The duration of fermentation is also longer as compared to beer and mostly fermented wine is aged (months to year) to develop desirable sensory characteristics (Figure 24.1). There are two major type of wines i.e. white wine (made from green grapes) and red wine (from red or blue grapes). The red wine contain anthocyanin (as colouring pigment) and subjected to secondary fermentation termed as “Malolactic fermentation” to mellow the flavour of wine. The alcohol content in wine ranges from 9-16% (v/v).   Sparkling wines are characterized by “effervescence” produced by carbon dioxide and clarity, example: Champagne.'"

Nourishment and well-being are achieved through the ecology of the specific production environment. For example, in the case of crops this is the living soil; for animals it is the farm ecosystem; for fish and marine organisms, the aquatic environment. Organic farming, pastoral and wild harvest systems should fit the cycles and ecological balances in nature. These cycles are universal but their operation is site-specific. Organic management must be adapted to local conditions, ecology, culture and scale. Inputs should be reduced by reuse, recycling and efficient management of materials and energy in order to maintain and improve environmental quality and conserve resources. Organic agriculture should attain ecological balance through the design of farming systems, establishment of habitats and maintenance of genetic and agricultural diversity. Those who produce, process, trade, or consume organic products should protect and benefit the common environment including landscapes, climate, habitats, biodiversity, air and water.'"

Sugar syrup is passed through a plate heat exchanger to decrease the microbial load. Syrup is pre-prepared, tested and diverted to proportioner for mixing with water and carbonation. Flow meters are most frequently used for proportioning. The syrup is dosed through a mass flow meter and the water dosing is done volumetrically by using a magnetic induction flow meter.'"

The level of carbonation varies between 1 to 4.5 volumes of CO 2 per litre of beverage; 1 volume for fruit based carbonated drinks, 2-3 volumes for colas and around 4.5 volumes for mixer drinks like tonic water, ginger ale. Use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles also requires slightly higher level of carbonation as some loss of CO 2 is bound to occur during storage.

1452,1311,"'27.1 Introduction Fruit beverages and drinks are one of the popular categories of beverages that are consumed across the globe. The fruit beverages and drinks are easily digestible, highly refreshing, thirst quenching, appetizing and nutritionally far superior to most of the synthetic and aerated drinks. In recent past the consumption of fruit based beverages and drinks has increased at a fast rate. Fruit juices or pulp used for the preparation of these products are subjected to minimal processing operations like filteration, clarification and pasteurization. The fruit juice or pulp, are mixed with ingredients like sugar, acid, stabilizers, micronutrients and preservative to develop beverages and drinks. There are various categories of fruit juice or pulp based beverages and drinks which are listed below. Natural fruit juices, sweetened juices, ready-to-serve beverages, nectar, cordial, squash, crush, syrup, fruit juice concentrate and fruit juice powder belong to the category of non-alcoholic and non-carbonated beverages. The principle groups of fruit beverages are as follows: • Ready-to-Serve (RTS) pre-packaged Beverages • Fruit juice and Nectars • Dilutable beverages'"
1453,1312,"'The ready-to-serve beverages as per FSSAI specifications should contain at least 10 percent fruit content and not less than 10 percent TSS besides 0.3% acid maximum as citric acid. The levels of permitted preservatives include 70 ppm (maximum) for sulphur dioxide and 120 ppm (maximum) for benzoic acid. The total plate count and yeast and mold counts should not exceed, to 50.0 cfu/ml and 2.0 cfu/ml, respectively. The Coliform counts should be nil in 100 ml beverage samples. Since these beverages are consumed as such without dilution, hence are termed as “Ready-to- serve” beverage. The majority of packaged fruit beverages belong to this category. Wide range of fruits including mango, citrus fruits, berries, litchi, guava, pineapple, grapes etc. are preferred for RTS beverages. Required amount of sugar, acid, stabilizer, colouring and flavouring ingredients are added in juice or pulp along with water and the mixture is blending properly, filtered if desired. The RTS mix is pasteurized (80-90 0 C) in bottle (20-30 min), continuous juice pasteurizer (few seconds to one minute) and cooled immediately. Nowadays, UHT processing of RTS beverages is quite popular because of longer shelf-life and less loss of nutrients during processing. The amount of fruit juice or pulp may vary according to fruit and cost effectiveness. The presence of oxygen in headspace often leads to oxidation resulting in off-flavour and loss of nutritive value, hence anti-oxidants such as ascorbic acid is often added in RTS beverages. Besides it, colour and flavour ingredients which are stable to heat and oxygen are preferred.'"
1454,1313,"'27.2.1 Natural fruit juice Natural fruit juices also falls in the category of RTS beverage. It may be defined as pure juice which is extracted from ripe and mature fruits and contain 100 percent fruit content. The juice is extracted by various methods and contains mainly sugars, acids, vitamins, minerals and other minor components. These are preserved by thermal processing and freezing. The commonly available fruit juices are apple, pineapple, citrus, grapes, pomegranate and mango. The sweetened juices are beverages which possess at least 85 percent juice and 10 percent TSS. The sugar and acids are added to increase the TSS content and also to balance the acid- to-sugar ratio. A wide variety of fruit juices are used for the purpose. Sometime two or more juices are mixed to develop a palatable and refreshing drink with better flavour and balanced nutrition. Such beverages are also called as “fruit punch”. In certain fruits the blending or mixing of juices is done to balance the acidity and minimize the flavor changes. Use of fruit juice concentrate with suitable dilution with water is mostly used on commercial scale to produce uniform quality product. Example: • Very sweet (grape) and very bitter (grapefruit) • Highly acidic (lime, lemon, sour cherry) with bland tasting fruits (pear, apple) • Highly flavoured (guava, banana) with bland & insipid tasting fruits (pear, loquat) The freshly squeezed juices have very short shelf-life; hence they have to be stored at 0-5 0 C to check spoilage.

Therefore, its goal is to create an integrated, environmentally sound, safe and economically sustainable agriculture production system. Soil is a living system linked to an organism with different components. Human interact with these natural components (minerals, organic matter, micro-organisms, animals and plants) to achieve harmony with nature and create a sustainable agricultural production. A key feature of organic farming is the primary dependence on natural resource and those developed locally (green manures, crop residues, farm wastes etc.), rather than external inputs (especially synthetics). The farmer manages self-regulating ecological and biological processes for sustainable and economic production of products. Organic farming systems do not use toxic agrochemical inputs (pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and fertilizers). Instead, they are based on development of biological diversity and the maintenance and replenishment of soil productivity.'"

Low temperature long time (LTLT – 63-65 o C/30 min) and high temperature short time (HTST – 72-90 o C/15-30 sec.) treatments are the most commonly used techniques for juice pasteurization. However, thermal pasteurization tends to reduce the product quality and freshness. Therefore, some non-thermal pasteurization methods have been proposed during the last couple of decades, including high hydrostatic pressure (HHP – pressures up to 1000 MPa with or without heat), pulsed electric field (PEF), etc. These emerging techniques seem to have the potential to provide “fresh-like” and safe fruit juices with prolonged shelf-life.'"

Two of the most commonly used preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate. However, consumer demand for natural origin, safe and environmental friendly food preservatives has been increasing since 1990s. Natural antimicrobials such as bacteriocins, organic acids, essential oils and phenolic compounds have shown considerable promise for use in some food products. Natural antimicrobials such as bacteriocins, lactoperoxidase , herb leaves and oils, spices, chitozan and organic acids have shown feasibility for use in some food products. Some of them have been considered as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) additives in foods. Bacteriocins are series of antimicrobial peptides which are readily degraded by proteolytic enzymes in the human body.

Depending on the physical form of the fruit (e.g., whole, paste, slices), different types of dryers must be used for drying. The advantages of fruit and vegetable drying are compensated by some negative changes that occur during drying, for example „heat damage‟ of heat-sensitive constituents (vitamins, enzymes, etc.); browning, shrinkage, and „case hardening‟; irreversible loss of ability to rehydrate; loss of volatile constituents; and changes in moisture distribution within the product.'"

However, for higher pH fruit juices over and above stringent pasteurization, chemical preservatives (i.e. salts of sorbic acid or benzoic acids) may be used, where permitted by laws. The main purpose is to prevent fermentation from occurring during the refrigerated or even ambient temperature storage.'"
1564,1403,"'Some fruit or vegetable powders are produced from juices, concentrates, or pulps by using a spray drying technique. Dry powders can be directly used as important constituents of dry soups, yogurt, etc. The drying is achieved by spraying of the slurry into an airstream at a temperature of 138°C to 150°C and introducing cold dry air either into the outlet end of the dryer or to the dryer walls to cool them to 38°C– 50°C. The most commonly used atomizers are rotary wheel and single-fluid pressure nozzle. A wide range of fruit and vegetable powders can be dried, agglomerated, and instantized in spray drying units, specially equipped with an internal static fluidized bed, integral filter, or external vibrofluidizer. Bananas, peaches, apricots, and to a lesser extent citrus powders are examples of products dried by such techniques.'"

Foam mat dried fruit or vegetable powders have fewer heat-induced changes in color and flavor than conventional spray dried or drum dried products. It yields product with lower density than that of a conventional dryer. The product density is about equal to the density of instantized or agglomerated powder. A stable gas-liquid foam is a prerequisite. Glycerol monostearate, solubilized soya protein, and propylene glycol monostearate are the typical additives for the fruit and vegetable foam formulation from juice or pulp. Foam mat drying involves drying a thin layer (0.1–0.5 mm) of the stabilized foam in air at 65°C–70°C for a few minutes, as the foam structure decreases drying time to about one-third. The foam is spread on perforated floor craters as the airstream is forced through the bed. A continuous belt tray dryer or a modified spray dryer can be used.'"

During the last two decades, there has also been a significant sensitization of the global community towards environmental preservation and assuring of food quality. Ardent promoters of organic farming consider that it can meet both these demands and become the mean for complete development of rural areas. After almost a century of development organic agriculture is now being embraced by the mainstream and shows great promise commercially, socially and environmentally. While there is continuum of thought from earlier days to the present, the modern organic movement is radically different from its original form. It now has environmental sustainability at its core in addition to the founders concerns for healthy soil, healthy food and healthy people.

Pathogens which are not host-specific and not mobile can be controlled by the choice and sequence of crops grown in the rotation supported by preventative measures increasing soil suppressiveness and plant health. Examples are the soil borne pathogens Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Rhizoctonia solani . Host-specific pathogens with high mobility such as Phytophthora infestans in potato cannot be controlled by crop rotation.'"
1893,1941,"'Preventative measures are sanitation in a cropping area and the choice of crop structure and planting date in combination with resistant varieties. In many situations also control measures such as applications of plant protection products may be needed to achieve sufficient yield. Also pathogens which are not host-specific but highly mobile cannot be controlled by crop rotation. Disease pr se products may be needed in many cases. Example for a mobile pathogen with a broad host range is Botrytis cinerea causing grey mould in various crops such as beans, peas, strawberries, grapes and many other crops. How differently various measures contribute to disease management in different crop-pathogen relationships will be illustrated by the comparison of two systems. In wheat, various Fusarium spp. can cause Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) leading to a decrease of yield and, more important, the production of mycotoxins in the grain. Fusarium sp have a host range and also can survive saprophytically. Mobility of spores of most sp is low.

2079,2127,"'Some fruits and vegetables, particularly certain varieties of peaches and potatoes, are scalded in steam or boiling water to soften and loosen the skin, which is subsequently removed easily by hand. It usually involves exposing the f for 10-60 seconds where by the skin bursts and retracts facilitating its easy removal by means of pressure sprays. To achieve good results, the fruits and vegetables should be of uniform size and maturity. Using this method, there is practically no loss of flavour and the product is of uniform colour, free from any blemishes.'"
2080,2128,"'Fruits and vegetables such as peaches, apricots, sweet orange, carrots, sweet potatoes, etc. are generally peeled by dipping them in boiling caustic soda or lye solution of 1 to 2 percent strength, for short periods, ranging from 0.5 to 2 minutes depending on the maturity of the fruit or vegetable. The hot lye loosens the skin from the flesh underneath. The peel is then removed easily by hand. Any traces of alkali is removed by washing the fruit or vegetable thoroughly in running cold water or preferably by dipping it for a few seconds in a very weak solution of hydrochloric or citric acid.'"
2081,2129,"'Blanching refers to the mild heat treatment given to fresh produce such as vegetables to inactivate enzymes. Polyphenol Peroxidase (PPO) is most important groups of enzymes causing browning, off-flavour development in fruits and vegetables. PPO cause oxidation of phenolic compound namely Catechin, Gallic acid, Chlorogenic acid and Caffeic acids. Besides PPO certain peroxidase and pectic enzymes are also require inactivation. Pectic enzymes such as Pectin methyl esterase (PME) and Polygalacturonase (PG) are highly meat resistance and if failed to inactivate may lead to loss of cloud in citrus juices and serum separation in fruits and vegetables products, respectively.  Their inactivation is the index of blanching. Blanching also improves colour, flavour and nutritional quality. Usually it is done with boiling water or steam for short periods, followed by cooling. In small scale industries, the fruit or vegetable to be blanched is placed in a wire of perforated basket, which is first dipped in hot water (88- C) for about 2-5 minutes. Microwave treatment is also used for blanching. Blanching requirement varies with different fruit or vegetable and depends upon relative enzyme concentration and maturity of commodity.'"
2082,2130,"'Ripening before processing may be required for certain fruits such as avocado, banana, kiwifruit, mango, nectarine, papaya, peach, pear, plum, melons, etc. that are picked immature. Ethylene treatment can be used to obtain faster and more uniform ripening. The optimum temperature range for ripening is 15- the faster the ripening. Relative humidity should be maintained between 90 and 95% during ripening. About 10 ppm ethylene in enclosed chamber is sufficient to initiate ripening. Ethylene is produced by the reaction between calcium carbide with moisture, mainly those involved in trade of fruits to hasten the ripening process. However, indiscriminate application may pose serious health hazards. Commercially ethephon is used for the pre-harvest ripening of top fruits, soft fruits, tomatoes and coffee. It is also used to facilitate the harvest of fruit and berry crops (by loosening the fruits) and to accelerate post-harvest ripening. It is essentially a plant growth regulator with systemic properties. It penetrates into the tissues and is translocated. It decomposes into ethylene which is the active metabolite.'"

Here the temperature of water will be lower than 0 0 C but it will remain in liquid form. At this stage, further lowering of temperature result in the formation of ice crystals. The second step is called crystal growth stage . The release of heat of crystallization further enhances temperature (BC). Since food molecules contain substantial amount of soSlute hence, a progressive freezing occurs as depicted in Fig. 10.1. Various water molecules gathers around nuclei and due to subsequent addition, crystal growth occurs.'"
2085,2133,"'Nucleation may be either due to chance orientation of molecule or due to induction of nuclei from outside, but in fruits & vegetable mostly chance nucleation occur. In next step, crystal growth around these nuclei occurs and as a result of ice-crystal formation, heat of crystallization is generated, which cause increase in temperature of commodity. This T es is shown by BC lines. So, time taken by freezing curve from initial cooling to E point of curve is known as thermal arrest time . It determines how quick or slow freezing process is.

This affects turgidity of cell and they collapse and on thawing cannot regain their original shape. Also, crystals forms are larger in size and pierce the cell membrane, puncture it and damage the cells. Whereas in quick freezing large numbers of nuclei are formed, hence having large numbers of crystals of smaller size evenly distributed within the cell and in the intercellular space. Since process is very quick, hence no concentration effect occur and commodities retain their original shape.'"

Removal of the water (75-90%) present in fresh commodity results in reduction in the water activity and ultimately resistance against most of the deteriorative agents.  The removal of water is carried out by the application of heat and this heat is usually supplied in the form of solar energy or artificially generated hot air.  Removal of moisture and exposure of heat often results in poor textural attributes, loss in nutritive value (vitamins), discolouration and loss of flavouring components.

Second falling rate period occurs when the partial pressure of water is below the saturated vapour pressure and the drying is by desorption.

However, non-toxicity, inertness to food constituent and good sensory attributes is other added attraction, while selecting any osmotic agent.  These are number of compounds available, satisfying above mentioned criteria, like, sucrose, glucose syrups, invert sugar, corn syrups, honey, and humectants such as sorbitol and glycerol. The kind of sugar utilized strongly affects the kinetics of water removal, and by increasing the molecular weight of osmotic substance, larger water removal could be achieved with little uptake of solutes. Low molecular weight substances (glucose, fructose, sorbitol etc.) favour the sugar uptake because of the high velocity of penetration of the molecules so that solid enrichment instead of dehydration is the main effect of the process. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an excellent osmotic agent for vegetables and other animal derived products, but its use with fruits is restricted because of alteration in taste and bleaching of colour.  Addition of NaCl to osmotic solution increased the driving force for drying owing to the a w lowering capacity of salt.  Synergistic effects between sugar and salt have also been observed.

It is a water removal process that involves the soaking of foods – mostly fruits and vegetables in hypertonic salt or sugar or in a combined solution, to reduce the water content while increasing the soluble solid content. Osmotic dehydration is undertaken to reduce the product water activity in minimal processing, which is carried out either at atmospheric pressure or at vacuum conditions. The raw material is placed in concentrated solutions of soluble solids with higher osmotic pressure and lower water activity. Water moves through the selective permeable membrane with much greater ease than in the dissolved substances.'"

Paddy is cultivated on about 44 million hectares in India and about 5. 9 million hectares in Uttar Pradesh under various conditions: irrigated, non-irrigated, inundated, non-irrigated, and flood-prone areas. There is a need to emphasize on the development of high-yielding hybrid varieties of rice for different conditions, namely, suitable irrigated and heterogeneous conditions. The first hybrid development programme started in China in 4964. Hybrid paddy is being cultivated in more than of area. Details of major hybrids are given in the table below. Hybrid paddy is cultivated in the same way as normal varieties. Trials have shown that hybrids yield 40-42 kuntal \'hectares\' more than normal varieties because they have a higher number of hairs and reticulate granules per plant and are suitable for heterogeneous conditions. It is known that hybrids are developed by the combination of male and female of two species with different genetic traits, in which the seed of the first generation is used as the new variety, because the first generation has a unique ooze capacity, which is able to give a higher yield than the best common varieties. Note that in the next generation, due to the disintegration of their combined qualities, the ooze capacity is greatly increased and the yield is reduced. As a result, hybrid seed farmers have to buy every year. Table 4: Major Hybrids and Properties of Paddy: S. Average yield of hybrid / period (day) Kuntal \'H.No. Developed year 4.

Different nutrients become available and are easily absorbed by the plants. 4. Use of chemical fertilizers / pesticides reduces atmospheric pollution. 56 There is an increase in yield. Organic materials based on agriculture are recycled. The use and importance of biofertilizers in the sugarcane crop As a result of the inclusion of improved varieties in sugarcane cultivation and intensive cultivation, adequate amounts of different nutrients are required to nourish the crops, which are supplied by the farmers only through chemical fertilizers. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers adversely affects the physical and chemical properties of the soil. At the same time, due to the ever-increasing price of chemical fertilizers, farmers are not able to use nutrients according to the demand of the crops, which also affects the crop yield. Nitrogen-supplementing biofertilizers (nitrogen fixation bacteria) 4. Azotobacter 2. Azospirillum 3. About 78% of nitrogen is available in the atmosphere but cannot be absorbed directly by plants due to its unavailability. Nitrogen fixation is done by bacteria by converting atmospheric nitrogen into nitrate, which is easily absorbed by plants. Phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB): Plants use only 40-45% of the amount of phosphorus given to the crop in the first year. Even in the second year, only 8-40 percent is used. The rest settles in the soil. Phosphatosalubilizing bacteria solubilize the unavailable phosphorus and convert it to the available state, which is easily absorbed by the plants. Thus, its use increases the phosphorus availability by 20 to 25%. The major phosphorus solvent bacteria are as follows - 4. Bacillus megaterium 2. Pseudomonas striata 3. Bacillus polymixa 4.

They eat the growing seeds, roots of plants and cause damage. 2. Root Stem: The stem of this insect is white like that of boiled rice. The stems stay in the center of the root and cause harm, as a result of which the plant turns yellow. 3. Narai insect (Gal mij): The borer of this insect affects the main stem inside the cow dung and forms an onion stem-shaped structure, which is called silver shoot or onion shoot. Such infested plants do not produce bali. 4. Leaf wrap insect: The borer of this insect is initially yellow in colour and later turns green, which feeds on the leaves by bending them lengthwise and scraping the green portion from inside. 5. Hispa: The girders of this insect eat the green part by making a tunnel in the leaves, which forms a blister-like formation on the leaves. Adult insects eat the green part of the leaves by scraping it |6. Bunka insect: The trunks of this insect make a shell by cutting the leaves parallel to its body and staying inside it eat the green part by scraping it by sticking to other leaves. 7.

The eggs hatch and penetrate the stems, damaging the main shoot, which shows white scales when they hatch, and white scales when they hatch. 8. Green shoots: The adults of this insect are green in colour and have black dots on both sides of the upper wings. Both the young and adult leaves of this insect cause harm by sucking the sap from the leaves, due to which the infested leaves first turn yellow and later dark brown and start drying from the tip down. 9. Brown shoots: The adults of this insect are brown with brown wings and the young are brown without wings. Both the young and the adults of this insect suck the sap from the leaves and buds and start drying, which is also called 'hopper burn', so that at the beginning of the outbreak, the plants are 40. White-backed shoots: The adults of this insect are brown and yellow-bodied with blackness. They have a white stripe on the wing joint. Infants are wingless white with white and black spots on the abdomen. Both young and adult leaves of this insect wither. They suck the sap between the anthers, causing the plant yellow44.Gandhi bug: Infants and adults of this insect are long-legged brown with a characteristic odor, which harms the milk produced in the grains during lactation.

2288,2361,'Land selection: Light or loamy sandy soil is suitable for millet. The drainage of the land needs to be good and the soil in which natural farming is to be done for the first time should be tested.'
2289,2362,"'Sowing Time and Temperature: As soon as the rains begin, millet should be sown by the second week of July. The millet plant needs a temperature of 25 Â° C to germinate and 30 to 3 Â° C to grow. Its plants give good yield even at 40 Â° C. Millet sowing method: In natural farming method, sowing millet on ridge is considered the best method. Sowing on the bed reduces the quantity of seed and saves up to 70% of water. And when the drain is irrigated, the roots of the crop grown on the bed move towards the water in search of moisture, which makes the roots more developed and the plant stronger. And if it rains and the field is waterlogged, there is less chance of damage to the crop grown on the beds. Seed rate: The natural cultivation of millets requires 5 kg / ha of certified seed. Seed treatment: Millet seeds are sown by treating them with \'Beejamrut,\' which protects the seeds from soil-borne diseases. Treating the seed leads to better germination and higher yield as a crop. Nutrient management: Prior to sowing for nutrient availability.'"

At the same time, 4 - 5 times 7 - 8 litres of Jeevamrut is mixed with 600 litres of water in the standing crop and used. Soil treatment: To protect the millet crop from soil-borne diseases, jeevamrut, a decoction of cow dung, is added to the soil. Irrigation: In the natural farming of millets, moisture is required in the field at the time of crop germination and grain filling. If not, irrigation should be done.'"

For field preparation, plough first with a cultivator and then use a rotavator 'harrow'. Organic fertilizers must be used. As much as possible, half of the nutrients should be provided by organic fertilizers. The species should be selected according to regional compatibility and seasonality. Pure and certified seeds should be sown after seed treatment. Balanced amounts of fertilizers should be used at the right time and in the right manner based on soil testing.

Intensive methods: In case of irrigated sowing: About 97% of the total wheat area in the state is irrigated but assured or assured irrigation is available in a small area. Hence, the sowing of wheat is often delayed. We have to decide in advance which variety of paddy to choose in kharif and which variety of wheat to sow in rabi. To get a good yield of wheat, it is necessary to sow paddy in time, so that the field is empty for wheat in October. Another thing to be noted is that puddling or leva in paddy causes the soil to harden. In heavy soils, it is advisable to sow wheat by first ploughing with a soil-reversing plough and then ploughing the soil twice with a disc harrow. Paddy stalks are cut into small pieces using disc harrows. To decompose them quickly, 45-20 kg. Nitrogen (as urea) per se. When preparing the field, it must be given at the first ploughing. The field is fully prepared in a single ploughing by a tractor-driven rotavator. |बुवाई: Wheat must be sown on time and at sufficient moisture. Late-maturing varieties must be sown on time, otherwise the yield decreases. As sowing is delayed, the rate of decline in wheat yields increases. Wheat yields increase from 3 to 4 kg / ha when sown from December onwards. And 4 to 5 k.g. / ha when sown in January. The rate per week decreases. Sowing wheat with a seed drill can save fertilizer and seed. 4'"

2354,1073,"'Kharif / Kharif Kharif / Rabi foodgrains Production and use of organic manure: Due to continuous use of chemical fertilizers, the soil condition and fertility of the soil deteriorates, hence the use of organic manures is now absolutely necessary. The use of organic manures considerably improves the physical condition of the soil, water retention and aeration, thereby preserving the fertility of the soil for a longer period of time. In the modern era, due to mechanization of agriculture, even rural areas lack cow dung manure. Hence, manure which is available at cheaper rates from sugar mills and is more nutritious than cow dung manure. Mud should not be used directly in the field as it is acidic and does not contain nutrients in the available state, and there is a high possibility of termite infestation. Therefore, it should be decomposed by scientific methods before being used in the field. The following two methods have been developed to make suitable manure from the soil: 4.

It includes steps designed to prevent problems before they occur and to correct deviations as soon as they are detected.  Such preventive control system with documentation and verification are  widely recognized by scientific authorities and international organizations as the most effective approach available for producing safe food.  b. HACCP involves a system approach to identification of hazard, assessment of chances of  occurrence of hazards during each phase, raw material procurement, manufacturing, distribution, usage of food products, and in defining the measures for hazard control.  In doing so, the many drawbacks prevalent in the inspection approach are prevented and HACCP overcomes shortcomings of reliance only on microbial testing.  c. HACCP enables the producers, processors, distributors, exporters, etc., of food products  to utilize technical resources efficiently and in a cost effective manner in assuring food safety.  Food inspection too would be more systematic and therefore hassle-free.

Earwigs also have fungal infections on their necks and fingers. The cervix and whole or half of the body is black. This causes the sand to break off and fall from the contour. Due to which the amount of yield is affected. 2. Brown spot disease: This fungal disease can occur in all stages of the plant. In the initial stage, these spots intermingle and dry the leaves prematurely. Due to the infection on the hairs and grains, the grains do not develop properly, the grains shrink, which reduces the yield. Prevention - Fungus-caused rashes and brown spots are major diseases of ragi (madua).

And if it rains and the field is waterlogged, there is less chance of damage to the crop grown on the beds. Seed Rate and Treatment: In natural farming, use 4-5 kg of clean and healthy seeds for an area of one hectare. Sesame seeds are sown by treating them with \'Beejamrutha,\' which protects the seeds from soil-borne diseases. Treating the seed leads to better germination and higher yield as a crop. Soil treatment: The sesame crop should be sprayed with jeevamrut, a decongestant, to protect it from soil-borne diseases.'"

The sesame crop should be sprayed with Jeevamrut 4-5 times at an interval of 5 days. Spraying once every 15 days alters the growth stage of the crops and as the organic carbon of the field increases, the amount of jeevamrut and ghanjeevamrut should be reduced. Ghanajeevamrut - Tons of \'Ghanajeevamrut\' should be mined and put in the field before sowing for nutrient availability. Achhadaan: In the natural farming of sesame, after Jeevamrut and Ghanajeevamrut, Achhadaan is done in the field, except for the crop, the rest of the vacant place is covered with stubble. This increases the organic carbon of the soil. And doing good farming in the field also gives relief from the serious problem of weeds.'"

Although primary producers obtain membership of PO voluntarily, the promoting institution should make efforts to bring all producers into the PO, especially the small producers. 1.18  Who is a primary producer?   Any person engaged in any activity connected with or related to any primary produce will be treated as producer. Primary produce means the produce of farmers from agriculture and allied activities or produce of persons engaged in handloom, handicrafts and other cottage industries, including any by-product and product resulting from ancillary activities thereof. Primary produce also includes any activity intended to increase the production or quality of aforementioned products or activities. Persons engaged in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery, sericulture, apiary, handloom, handicrafts, etc., can become members of appropriate PO. Persons engaged in collection of minor forest produce are also eligible for membership of PO although they gather these from forests and strictly are not producers. 1.19  Can a person become member of more than one PO?   Family is the unit of production in rural areas. Benefits from the PO will accrue to members in proportion to the volume/value of produce given to the PO. Therefore, one person from a family can provide the whole produce of the family to the PO and get the same amount of benefit as multiple members providing the same volume/value. If however there are two different POs in the vicinity, each for a different type of produce, say vegetables and milk, one person can become member of both these POs, if the family produces both milk and vegetables.'"

The limitation is that surplus generated by such a PO cannot be divided among members by way of dividend etc. The PO can re-invest the surplus to grow the business. Comparison of PO registered under different Acts governing non-profit institutions is given below: Comparative Chart for Non-Profit Legal Forms'
2466,2487,"'It is preferable for the PO to work as a legal entity. Only such an entity can enter into legally valid contracts including mobilization of funds from other institutions. There are specific Acts under which the PO could be registered. It is also possible for a PO to migrate from one legal form to another. While choosing a legal form, the following factors may be kept in view:  a. Primary producers should benefit from the surplus generated by the PO. b. Process of Registration should not be too demanding in terms of time and  resources.  c. The legal form needs to fit into its business needs, organizational priorities, social  capital and management capacity.'"

Therefore, the members should be actively involved from the very beginning. The facilitating agency should facilitate a process that results in producers taking the initiative to set up the PO and let the members drive the process. Activities like awareness creation, identification of potential members should precede the actual formation formalities.'"

The productive land under an FPO may be around 4000 ha.  c. The PO may cover generally one or two contiguous Gram Panchayats for ease of  management.   d. The number of farmer producers that need to be covered may be around 700 to 1000. e. The cost of managing a Producer Organisation of the above nature may be around Rs.  2 lakh per month or Rs. 24 lakh per annum.  f. The total value of the produce of the farmers/non-farmers handled by the Producer  Organisation may be around Rs. 2.5 crore, assuming that approximately 10% of the total turnover of the PO may be reasonably spent towards cost of management.   g. Further, the markets selected for the Producer Organisation for selling their produce  may be within 200 KM to make their marketing activities viable.'"
2471,2497,"'a. A Farmers Producer Organisation is to be designed in such a way to cover all the lands  that fall in one or two micro watersheds.  b. The sustainability of the farmers of the micro watersheds is already in existence with  various types of productive activities of the farmers to take care of risk factors, like variations in the market prices of various produce, continuity of income etc. which include sustainable agricultural practices.    c. The secret to sustainability of a PO depends on comprehensive engagement of the PO  with their members throughout the year.  d. The design variables for a PO are mainly size, scope, technology, ownership of  resources, management and purpose.  These variables need to be aligned to meet the sustainability requirements indicated in the earlier two points.    e. The size of the PO should be small to be able to be managed by the local talent  available in the area of the PO.  f. The scope of the PO should be defined in such a way that there shall be good number  of crops to be grown to maintain the soil health, support for allied activities like dairy, nutritional security of the local people and to mitigate risk.  g. The technology adopted by the PO should be such that majority of the local people or  members of the families of the PO should be able to adopt to it and work with it with minimal training, effectively.  h. The management of the PO should take into account the incubation of the local youth  in such a way that in a few years' time, say in 3-7 years, local youth should be able to take over and manage the PO effectively.  i.'"
2472,2498,"'The purpose of the PO at all times must be to serve the larger needs of the community  and the ownership of the PO always should rest with all its members.  1.30 What should be the minimum and maximum number of members in a PO? The minimum number of membership depends on the legal form of the PO. For example, 10 or more primary producers can incorporate a Producer Company under Section 581(C) of Indian Companies Act 1956 (same provisions are retained in the 2013 Act). There is no restriction on the maximum number of membership. Generally, the PO will require certain minimum scale of operation to remain in business. This operation scale/volume is known as break-even level. Studies have shown that a PO will require about 700 to 1000 active producers as members for sustainable operation. 1.31 Who can become a Producer Organisation Promoting Institution (POPI)? An NGO, a bank branch, a Government Department, a Cooperative Society or any Association or Federation can become a POPI. Basically, the POPI needs to be a legal entity so that it can enter into legally valid contracts with other institutions including the PO which they seek to promote. Support is available for POPIs from SFAC and NABARD for meeting part of the recurring cost incurred for promotion of the PO based on individual project considerations. Details are available in the website of NABARD, SFAC and Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India.'"

Creating value to the members by solving existing problems in the value chain, marketing and reasonable share of price realisation in the rupee spent by the consumer on the members' produce, should be the focus.  All other activities / services should be to engage the members comprehensively throughout the year and to reduce their expenditures and increase their welfare.  b. **Good Governance**:  Governance which is responsible, transparent and keeping the  interest of the members of the PO above all the considerations is a must for the success of a PO.  Various aspects of good governance to be covered.  c. **Sustainability**: Another most important aspect to be covered in the training is that the  PO should not venture into unsustainable ventures which may create short term profits and harm the long term interests / welfare of the community.  d. **Networking**: The success of a PO depends on the networking and continuous  interactions with various stakeholders.  The BODs and staff should have the understanding and importance of networking to obtain maximum benefits to their members under convergence mode.  e. **Social Capital**: The training should concentrate on making the PO relevant to the  members at all times, which creates social capital and trust.   f. **Statutory Requirements**: The BoD and staff should have an understanding of the  constitution of the PO, statutory provisions under which it is formed, various other requirements under the statute and compliance thereof.  g. **Business Planning**: The training should cover aspects of business planning to maximise  benefits as well as to reduce the business risks.'"

2561,2477,"'A Producer Organisation (PO) is a legal entity formed by primary producers, viz. farmers, milk producers, fishermen, weavers, rural artisans, craftsmen. A PO can be a producer company, a cooperative society or any other legal form which provides for sharing of profits/benefits among the members. In some forms like producer companies, institutions of primary producers can also become member of PO. 1.2  What is the need for PO?  The main aim of PO is to ensure better income for the producers through an organization of their own.  Small producers do not have the volume individually (both inputs and produce) to get the benefit of economies of scale. Besides, in agricultural marketing, there is a long chain of intermediaries who very often work non-transparently leading to the situation where the producer receives only a small part of the value that the ultimate consumer pays. Through aggregation, the primary producers can avail the benefit of economies of scale. They will also have better bargaining power vis-à-vis the bulk buyers of produce and bulk suppliers of inputs. 1.3  What is a \'Farmers Producer Organisation\' (FPO)?  It is one type of PO where the members are farmers. Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) is providing support for promotion of FPOs. PO is a generic name for an organization of producers of any produce, e.g., agricultural, non-farm products, artisan products, etc. 1.4  Can there be a PO for non-farmers?  Yes. The PO is an organization of the primary producers. If the produce in question is a nonfarm item (for example, handloom or handicraft), then the PO will be that of non-farmers. The objective of the PO is to ensure better income realization to its members (who are producers) through aggregation and, if feasible, value addition. 1.5  What are the essential features of a PO?  a.'"

In brief, the PO could undertake the following activities:  a. Procurement of inputs b. Disseminating market information c. Dissemination of technology and innovations d. Facilitating finance for inputs e. Aggregation and storage of produce f. Primary processing like drying, cleaning and grading g. Brand building, Packaging, Labeling and Standardization h.

2573,2489,"'A PO will support the members in getting more income by undertaking any/many/all of the activities listed under point 1.14 above. By aggregating the demand for inputs, the PO can buy in bulk, thus procuring at cheaper price compared to individual purchase. Besides, by transporting in bulk, cost of transportation is reduced. Thus reducing the overall cost of production. Similarly, the PO may aggregate the produce of all members and market in bulk, thus, fetching better price per unit of produce. The PO can also provide market information to the producers to enable them hold on to their produce till the market price become favourable. All these interventions will result in more income to the primary producers. 1.16  What are other benefits for the members of a PO (other than better income)?  A PO is a collective of farmers (and non-farmers) who are the primary producers of a product (an agricultural produce or a manufactured product). It, therefore, can work as a platform to facilitate better access to government services, like PDS, MNREGA, Scholarships and Pensions, etc. It can liaison with the Government Departments for convergence of programmes, like drinking water, sanitation, health and hygiene. 1.17  Who can become member of a PO?  PO is an organization of the producers, specifically the primary producers. All primary producers residing in the relevant geography, and producing the same or similar produce, for which the PO has been formed, can become member of the PO. Membership is voluntary. The procedure for obtaining PO membership depends on the bye-laws of the PO. The founder-members are those who were there at the time of formation of the PO. Other members join the PO later.

In the initial years, professional and managerial assistance is usually extended by the POPI. As the leaders of the PO gain experience, they should take over the affairs of the PO completely. 1.21  Can a PO engage professionals to manage its business?  All legal forms provide for engaging professional and other employees by the PO. Such persons should be paid out of the income of the PO. As far as possible, the income should come from value addition to the produce and not from price paid to members. If members get price less than the market, they will gradually move away from the PO. The professionals and other employees should be paid at par with the prevailing market to ensure that they remain for long with the PO. Compensation will also depend upon the business plan, ensuring a positive surplus. 1.22  Can a PO procure produce from non-members?  The objective of the PO is to ensure better income to the member-producers through aggregation and value addition. Therefore, procurement from non-members is usually not undertaken. However, market exigencies at times may necessitate such procurement. There should be provision in the by-laws of a PO to enable procurement from non-members during such exigencies. 1.23  Can a PO sell the produce in the commodity exchanges?  Yes, it can. The PO can aggregate the produce of its members, and sell it using the commodity exchanges. The produce needs to meet the quality standards specified by the commodity exchanges, and be stored scientifically in approved warehouses. The PO can become a member of the Commodity Exchanges to do trading directly, or else it can sell through the exchange-approved brokers.'"

For non-farm produce (handloom, handicrafts etc.), there are other quality specifications and other stipulations against using child labour, etc. 1.25  How much expenses will be incurred for registration of a PO?  Expenditure towards registration fee, stamp duty, preparation of documents and facilitation charges etc., will depend on the legal structure of the PO.

2581,2521,"'PACS, being a registered cooperative society, has been providing credit and other services to its members. It has been observed that PACS are generally meeting the credit requirements of its members. However, there is a need to provide other services to the farmers and hence, PACS should be developed as a unit to meet all their needs. PACS are generally providing the following facilities to the members:  i.  Input facilities in form of cash or kind component to members  ii.  Agriculture implements on hiring basis  iii.  Storage facility  PACS can play an important role in providing these facilities to the farmers.  In order to enable PACS to provide more services to its members and generate income, an initiative was taken to develop PACS as multi service centres.  Some of the PACS are also assisting farmers in marketing of their produce. Thus, PACS can provide both backward and forward linkages to its members, thereby acting as a PO, in order to promote efficient crop production practices for its members on one hand and opportunities for better price realisation of their produce, on the other.  Following facilities can be taken up by PACS acting as a PO to the farmers:  a) **Agro-Storage centre:**  a. Upgradation of the existing storage facility or construction of new godown  along with sorting/ grading unit as per Negotiable Warehouse Receipt System. This will enable them to issue warehouse receipts. Based on these receipts, the farmers can get loan against the crop stored and can cultivate the next crop. Thus, the farmers will be facilitated to get better price by holding the crops without affecting the fund flow position.  b) **Agro-service Centre:**  a.

2598,2602,"'7.1 What is the concept of value chain development?  Value chain comprises all the activities at different yet interlinked stages that add value to a particular product through the different phases of production, including procurement of raw materials and other inputs. Usually, there are many actors along the value chain for producing, transforming/processing and bringing goods and services to end-consumers through a series of sequential activities. When the produce originates from agriculture, we call it an agricultural value chain. Let us take the case of milk. For producing milk, the farmer requires milch cattle, feed and fodder and shed for the cattle. After milking (once/twice a day), the milk is taken to the collection centre where the volume, fat and SNF contents are measured. From the collection centre, milk is transported to the Bulk Milk Chilling Unit, where the milk is filtered and chilled to keep it fresh. From there, it goes to Milk Processing Plant, where bacteria is de-activated through pasteurization, and different types of milk and milk products are made. Liquid milk (whole milk, toned milk, vitamin-A fortified milk) is made into packets and sent to wholesalers. The retailers get milk packets from the wholesalers and sell to the consumers through milk booth and/or through door delivery. Processed milk products like butter, curd, cheese, ghee etc., also reach the end-consumers from the processing facility thorough the same channel. The whole chain from purchasing of milch cattle to delivery of milk packets to consumers is the value chain for milk. Though value is added at each stage, major addition takes place through Milk Chilling, Pasteurisation and Processing. All the persons/agencies undertaking one or more activities in this chain are called the actors in the value chain.'"

2604,2611,"'The goal is not to eliminate risk altogether (an impossible proposition) but to identify them and assess whether they can be managed or minimised through operational resilience. If the risks or threats seem unmanageable then one may discard the business idea all together. Even after starting the business, the risks continue to remain in the business environment, internally and externally both. Hence, it is important to develop risk assessment mechanism and risk mitigation strategy. There are five key steps in the development of this strategy.  a. The first step is to identify and map the processes/factors that would have the biggest  impact on earnings, if disrupted. For example, bad monsoon will severely affect crop production in rain-fed areas thus reducing earning of the PO considerably.  b. The second step is to identify critical infrastructure —including processes,  relationships, people, regulations, plant, and equipment—that supports the PO's ability to generate earnings. For example, if there is break-down in the Bulk Milk Chilling Unit, the whole stock of milk will be spoilt and go waste, besides adversely affecting the supply chain.   c. The third step is to identify the main vulnerabilities. Vulnerability is inability to cope  with the adverse effects of an event or risk. For example, storage, processing and trading of commodities can come under new regulation, imposing conditions, which the PO may find difficult to comply with, at short notice.   d. The fourth step is to identify the weakest links, the elements on which all the others  depend. For example, if there is a single buyer for all produces, this is the weakest link.   e. The last step is to develop planned response to mitigate the risks. For example, the  enterprise may build redundancies in some critical infrastructure like a spare refrigerated van for ferrying chilled milk.'"

Working capital loan may be a part of a composite loan (term loan + working capital) or separate limit. There are different methods of working out the working capital limit. Normally banks provide 20% of the annual turnover as working capital loan.'"
2621,2846,"'The quantum of working capital requirement depends on various unit specific internal factors, like, operating efficiency, technology employed and the level of quality control and external factors, like, demand and supply gap, nature of activity, availability of production inputs (raw material, labour, power & fuel), and availability of credit, etc. Thus, the working capital would depend on the prevailing conditions, level and type of business. It may change with time. The banks, therefore, review and reassess the working capital requirements of borrowing enterprises on a regular basis. There are several methods to assess the working capital requirement used by Banks. The methods like Cash Budget System, Turnover Method, Maximum Permissible Bank Finance (MPBF) System, and Net Owned Funds System, depending on the type of activity, are used by financial institutions. A. Cash Budgeting Method: Cash budgeting is done for a year, with month to month cash flows being taken up for analysis. Information required (to be called for from the borrower) is as follows:  i. Balance sheet for the previous financial year (In case of existing PO)  ii. Projected balance sheet for the budget year iii. Projected profit and loss account for the budget year iv. Estimate of monthly sales and purchases  v. Estimate of monthly expenses and incomes other than from purchases and sales (the table below gives some of the heads of inflows and outflows) vi. Seasonality factors in the business, if any From this information, the cash flow is computed as follows.'"
2622,2847,"'Cash inflow: Opening cash/bank balance (+) amount of receivables at the beginning of the month (+) sales (–) amount of receivables at the close of the month Cash Outflow: Payments made for raw materials/consumables (opening trade credits (+) purchases (-) trade credits at the end of the month); payment made to fixed asset suppliers; payment of interest; Payment of tax; payment towards other expenses such as labour, utilities, etc.; closing cash balance  Particulars / Months  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  S No 1  Opening cash balance  2  Receipts - sales  3  Collection of receivables   4  Miscellaneous receipts  A Cash inflow (1 TO 4)  1  Payments for raw material  2  Payment for consumables  3  Payment to creditors  4  Payment for fixed assets   5  Taxes, interest and Labour payments  6  Other payments  7  Closing cash balance  B Cash outflow (1 to7)  Difference between cash Out flow and inflow (B- A)'"
2623,2848,"'The difference between inflow and outflows of cash would clearly indicate period when the business is short of cash and to what extent it requires funding. There would be variations in the cash deficit from month to month. The peak level of cash deficit would be the outer limit of working capital requirements. A two track working capital limit, one at the base level taking care of the normal requirements over the year and another additional limit to take care of increased seasonal demands, is worked out. B. Projected Annual Turnover (PAT): The working capital credit limits provided by lending banks is at a minimum level of 20% of the Projected Annual Turnover (PAT). This norm is applicable in case of units (new as well as existing), village and tiny units with aggregate fund based 'working capital credit limits up to Rs.5 Crore from the banking system. The term PAT is with Gross Sales and not Net Sales.   a. The lending norms presuppose that the working capital requirements of a unit  may be considered as 25% of the value of output or PAT. Banks normally  provide 4/5th  or 80% of this amount, the residual portion to be brought in by  the promoter by way of margin from long term sources. The working capital credit limits provided by banks is at a minimum level of 20% of the projected annual turnover.   b. The total working capital requirements of a unit, pegged at 25% of PAT,  assumes an average working capital cycle of 3 months. In reality though, different units with different activities have different working capital cycle patterns at levels higher and lower than the average cycle of 3 months.'"
2624,2849,"' It is therefore, necessary that the permissible level of bank credit is also assessed by using other methods of appraisal as applicable in each case along with the PAT based appraisal of credit requirements for units.'"

The borrowers are sanctioned a limit for meeting their operating expenses and are free to draw and repay as many times as required, within the sanctioned limit and within 12 months period.   k.

However, in case of a new PC this opportunity will not be there.  b. **Suppliers' Credit and Advance Payment from Buyers:** Suppliers' Credit can be  obtained from credit companies or from potential buyers and sellers. The producers who sell their products to the PO, can sell on credit. PO can get part payment in advance from prospective buyers. It can get agriculture inputs from the Agro dealers on the conditions of payment after sales. But mostly this type of finance is not available for start-up businesses or a new venture.  c. **Equity**: In case of a PC the equity comes from the members and no external financier  can participate in the equity investment.   d. **Grant support:** The PC being a small holders' organization may seek capital support  and other assistance from the Government under certain government schemes. Two  major initiatives to support Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) (i) support to the equity base of FPOs by providing matching equity grants, and (ii) setting up of a Credit Guarantee Fund to provide cover to banks which advance loans to FPOs without collateral has been announced by GoI. The Schemes will be implemented by Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). Details are given in Appendix ii. Funding may also be available from the Department of Rural Development and Panchayats, Ministries of Agriculture and Cooperation or Horticulture or Food Processing GoI and or state Governments under various schemes like National and State Horticulture Mission, Small Agribusiness Consortium.

2632,2857,"'A DPR is a formal application for availing the credit support from any funding agency. It should provide details about the organization, Business plan, Marketing Plan, Operation and Management Plan, Financial projections and financial requirements. Although there would be some NGOs and Producer Organizations that are experienced in preparing DPRs, typically a Producer Organization would require assistance in preparation of the DPR through experts/ professional, which may involve some cost.     9.13 Is any support available for preparation of DPR?  SFAC provides Project development Facility (PDF) for Equity Grant and Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for the preparation of Equity Grant Application and Detailed Project Reports (DPR) through empanelled consultants/institutions. SFAC will cover the full cost of preparation of DPR. This facility will be available for FPC only. FPC desirous of assistance may approach the nearest empanelled consultant or SFAC directly. In addition to three broad categories of support (i.e. credit support, capacity building & market linkage) under PODF, NABARD provides grant support for preparation of DPR up to 0.5% of the project cost or Rs. 1.0 lakh whichever is lower, subject to the fact that the project is sanctioned by NABARD. The grant assistance would be within the overall cap of 20% of the loan amount.    9.14 If Banks do not provide credit facility, what are the options available for POs? A newly formed PO does not have enough share capital, reserves and credentials for doing successful business, therefore mobilizing funds from banks is difficult in the initial phase. With all the costs included, the PO may face huge financial burden from the beginning and the idea of setting up PO may not even take off.  To overcome the problem, the POs may adopt the following business model in the initial years before they generate reserves and establish credentials.  a.'"
2633,2858,"'Choose those activities in the initial years which require very less capital or no capital  and which are risk free.   b. Take Dealership of seeds and fertilizers from the companies and work as commission  agents. POs can earn good margin and a business relationship with those companies which resulted in getting credit limit in the subsequent years.   c. Dealership from various companies for various agriculture implements like water  pump sets, mechanized plough, etc., which they can sell to their members at a reasonable price and earn commission.   d. Procurement of agriculture produce. The POs identified the prospective buyers and  arranged buy back guarantee from them. Sell was organized at the farm gate level, therefore no transportation and storage cost were involved at the PO level. PO ensured a transparent transaction between the buyers and sellers (members and nonmembers both) and by doing so they earned some margin from the buyers.   e. Many POs took the advantage of GoI scheme, which provide 80% of the value of  produce as loan against pledge of Warehouse Receipts (WHR) without collateral.    The successful demonstration of such business would build their credentials among the members and other stakeholders. Further, Demonstration of fair trade practices is very important for the PO. These small activities give POs the opportunity to demonstrate such practices. Both the members and the trade and industry with whom PO does the business appreciate such fair practices and it builds reputation for the PO.     9.15 Provide a Sample Format for Preparation of a DPR?

2667,2896,"'Monitoring can be defined as a systematic collection and analysis of information of an ongoing project. It is aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the project implementation so as to derive maximum benefits for the producers/PO. 10.2  What is efficiency?  Efficiency speaks about whether the output in terms of benefits exceed the expenditure. It is the ratio of output and input. Funding agency will monitor how efficient the POPI and PO has been in implementing the project. Similarly, the PO will monitor the same at the farmers 'producers' level. Certain parameters like the amount spent per farmer vis-a-vis the increase in income could be one indicator of efficiency. Higher the increase in income for the same amount spent, higher is the efficiency. 10.3  What is effectiveness?   Effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which the project achieved the specific objectives it set.   For example, if the objective of a project is to increase the income levels of all the farmers 'producers' engaged with the PO, we have to measure the extent of increase in income.  Similarly, if one of the objective is to increase the volume of the produce, we shall measure the extent of increase.   These assessments will indicate how effective the program has been. Higher the increase in income levels, higher would be the effectiveness of the project. 10.4  Who will monitor the Project?   The project is to be monitored by the PO, POPI and funding agency. 10.5 What is to be monitored by the PO? The PO has to satisfy itself that it is able to function in a sound manner for meeting the expectations of all the stakeholders. It also needs to monitor work execution at the producer level.'"
2668,2897,"'The PO has to prepare a work schedule/time line in consultation with the POPI for procurement of inputs, execution of works, marketing of produce. Accordingly, at each stage, review and monitoring has to be done by the PO. The PO has to evolve suitable formats for collecting data for the purpose of review and monitoring. 10.6 What is to be monitored by the POPI? The POPI has to monitor the work of the PO as well as ground level achievements. It has to assess the extent of progress of the work from time to time and if required suggest suitable measures. It has to arrange to design specific formats and provide to the PO. The PO will collect data in the specified formats and submit to the POPI and to funding agency.  Besides the progress, the POPI should also monitor staff availability for the project, data on individual producer, cost involved, availability of inputs, volume of produce, income, verification of the books of the PO etc., and submit detailed report to the funding agency on the agreed intervals, say monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly. 10.7  What is to be monitored by the Funding Agency: The funding agency has to evolve suitable formats for the submission of returns by PO/POPI. The funding agency has to monitor the targets vis-a-vis achievements, quality of implementation, participation of members and adequacy of training programmes. Monitoring enables the funding agency to determine whether the resources available are adequate and capacity of the human resources to implement the project is adequate.  Monitoring could be at desk level (office) or field level. 10.8  What is desk monitoring? Desk monitoring includes internal review of the project by the project funding agency.'"
2669,2898,"'It is difficult for the funding agency or the POPI to conduct field visits at frequent intervals, hence based on the returns submitted by the agency, desk review of the progress could be done. The findings could be discussed in a forum where POs and POPIs can participate. Based on the discussions, bottlenecks in the implementation could be identified, discussed and remedial measures initiated. The POPI will undertake review based on both the reports submitted by the PO and its own staff involved in the field. The review may involve the participation of PO at agreed intervals, so as to improve the implementation of the project. At every level, i.e., at the level of funding agency, POPI and PO, suitable formats for submission of data and suitable templates for presentations need to be evolved. The returns to be submitted by the PO should include:  a. Business projections/ assumptions submitted in proposal and comparison with  actual progress  b. Disbursements - Targets and achievements c. Repayments - Dues  and their repayment and overdue amount d. Operations of Designated Account; and Up-to-date correspondence with borrower e. Stock statements, annual report, latest balance sheet and P&L statements (If the  review is after annual closing)  f. Any pending compliance with terms and conditions  After obtaining the returns POPI and funding agency should:    a. Review progress b. Identify problems in planning and/or implementation c. If required make adjustments in release of funds to producers organization   10.9   Whether the desk level monitoring gives any 'Early Warning Signals'? What are they? One of the objectives of desk monitoring is to identify the 'Early Warning Signals'.'"
2670,2899,"'There could be deviation in the implementation plan, violation of terms and conditions, shortfall in achievement, overdue amounts at the level of PO, operation of designated accounts, inadequacy of suitable  field staff, reduced participation of PO or POPI or the producers, which are to be closely monitored and if required, an immediate field level monitoring needs to be taken up.    10.10 What is Field Level Monitoring? Field level monitoring involves collection of actual data at the field level. It involves collection of 'elaborate' data from the field level by interacting with the farmers/producers and other stake holders. Specific proforma on the pattern of the format suggested in Chapter 9 could be evolved for collection of data or depending upon the requirement suitable proforma need to be designed for collection of data. Often, field level monitoring data on the following aspects is also important as these factors provide leads to the success or failure of the project:  a. Availability of inputs to members - timeliness b. Technical support available to members - targeted Vs. actual frequency c. Storage and processing arrangement - planned Vs. achievement  d. Marketing tie-up - planned benefits Vs. actual benefits e. Targeted Productivity / Income growth Vs. Actual achievements f. Members views regarding the services provided by PO and its efficacy   10.11 How to Plan Monitoring of Projects? Monitoring should be a part of planning process.  It is desirable to frame monitoring parameters in the beginning of planning process itself. These parameters should be in line with the objectives of the project. Therefore, the funding agency, POPI and the PO have to begin gathering information about performance in relation to targets from the beginning itself.  In fact, the first information gathering should take place when the project is planned. 10.12  What indicators can we suggest?'"
2671,2900,"'Indicators are measurable or tangible signs that the project or the PO has to achieve.  For example, some indicators are increase in productivity, production, income at the level of producers, improvement in the economy of the area leading to establishment of micro enterprises, increase in employment opportunities, community empowerment in terms of arresting migration, improvement in health and hygiene, infrastructure, women participation, women empowerment etc.  Through the indicators one can ask and answer questions such as: Who? - Who are befitting from the project? How many? - Number of people benefitted. How much? - What is the extent of benefit? Some examples of Indicators could be as follows: Please note that these are illustrative and are related to agriculture projects - they may or may not suit the needs of other Non-farm based projects. Economic Development Indicators  a.  Average size of land holding  b.  Average size of irrigated area  c.  Major crops with area and yield  d.  Items of investment  e.

Structure of different insitutions  g.  Participation rate in elections, by age and gender  h.  Participation in public meetings, by age and gender  10.13 How to develop indicators? Indicators are developed based on the objectives / impact assessment of the project. For example, in an agriculture based project, the following might be the objectives:  a. To improve the producer's income b. To develop the area under agriculture c. To arrest migration d. To improve marketing facilities e. To bring change in the quality of lives of the people f. To create awareness on sustainability of natural resources g. To improve the participation of women in the developmental process to address  gender issues  h. To bring awareness on  savings, investment and credit availability i. To bring awareness on social situation (housing, health, education etc.)  j. To improve the organizational situation (local governance, community participation  in the projects, women participation, etc.)  k. To improve Infrastructure facilities like storage, marketing and input availability'"

Finally, the incremental income will determine the success or otherwise of the intervention of the PO. The incremental income can be determined as shown below:  Before PO's intervention  Yield/ha Total  Total income  S No  Name of farmer's/producer's  Crop  Price/ qtl  Cropped Area (ha)  Yield (quintals)   Qtl= Quintal; ha = hectare; After PO's intervention  S No  Crop  Yield /ha  Price / qtl  Total income  Cropped Area (ha)  Total Yield (quintals)  Name of farmer's / producer' s  Net Increm ental Income  Any other Income / Dividen d / Bonus'"

There are 3 sampling techniques: random sampling, stratified sampling and cluster sampling Random sampling:  Sampling of households on random basis Stratified sampling:  The producers are categorized into different strata like big, medium and small.  Data are collected from each strata in a specified proportion  i.e., say,  every fifth producer's household data from the big producers, every third producer's house hold data from small producers  every second house hold data  from the very small producers' category Cluster sampling: In this case, data of only those producers households will be collected who are in the cluster for a specified period 10.17 How to analyze the data?

2766,2992,"'1.1 Chhattisgarh is among the few states in India that have recorded impressive growth in agriculture in recent years. Development of farmers own institutions catering to their various needs, has kept pace with the agricultural growth. As on 30 September 2014, the state had 3,679 farmers clubs (FCs). There were eight federations of farmer clubs in the state, five in Mahasamund, two in Bilaspur and one in Mungeli district. In Bilaspur and Mungeli districts (the study area), 300 FCs were formed, of which 201 were active. Majority of the farmer clubs (129 clubs) were formed by the Regional Rural Bank (Gramin Bank). Other promoting institutions include Chhattisgarh Agricon Samiti (30), CARMDAKSH (12), SBI (12), ARDB (8) and IFFDC (5). While all the clubs were active in the initial three years, many slipped into dormancy through inaction and non-availability of hand-holding support. These clubs did not have any vision or roadmap for the future. 1.2 The Chhattisgarh RO and DDM Bilaspur were keen to make the farmer clubs a sustainable entity and felt the need to federate the clubs to a higher tier so as to make the entire farmer clubs programme sustainable and the organization a viable model. With this in view, the farmer clubs were federated into four farmer club federations and were registered under 'Chhattisgarh Society Registrikaran Adhiniyam, 1973' in the year 2012.'"
2767,2993,"'1.3 To promote financial literacy among the farmers and school children, NABARD Chhattisgarh RO engaged the Farmers Club Federations and provided financial assistance. Initially 10 awareness programmes and 20 quiz programmes were sanctioned for Bilaspur and Mungeli districts and organized by the Farmer Club Federations (FCF). As the federations and farmer clubs are village level bodies and have local presence and acceptance, they could mobilize children and their parents in good numbers. Looking at the encouraging results, the RO sanctioned more awareness and quiz programmes at different times thereafter. This provided much needed scope for interaction between the DDM, Farmer Federations, bank officials and the Government officials which paved way for making the federations financially sustainable entities.'"
2768,2996,"'1.6 Due to greater acceptability of the federations in the villages, State Bank of India (SBI) approved opening of Kiosks under BC model through federations to achieve financial inclusion. As on September 2014, 16 kiosks were working through three farmer club federations. SBI was in the process of establishing 14 more Kiosks at other village centres in the next one year in the district. The Kiosks were attached to the nearest branch and worked under the guidance of the concerned Branch Manager. The Branch Manager supervises and monitors the work of the Kiosks (BC). 1.7 At present, the Kiosks are mainly involved in providing banking services like, opening of savings bank accounts, recurring deposit accounts, acceptance of deposits and payment towards withdrawal. The kiosks are also dispensing old age pensions, student scholarships, MNREGA payments and other social sector payments, routed by the Government. The present monthly income (Rs. 8000 to Rs. 14,000) of the Kiosk is mainly from banking services. The expenditure involved was salary to the operator, rent of the premises, interest on the initial investment etc., which is about Rs. 8000 to Rs. 10,000 (Salary of the operator-Rs.4000 to Rs. 5000, Premises rent-about Rs. 2000 to Rs. 3000).'"
2769,2997,"'1.8 Many of the leaders of the Farmer Club Federations (FCFs) got registered individually with Agriculture Department as seed farmers. The FCFs realized that there may be some business sense in establishing their own seed processing facility. This would be a step forward in the seed value chain, besides serving the needs of its famer members. 1.9 This breakthrough came in the form of 'Kisaan Beej' a 'Producer Organization' formed by a group of farmers from Arpanchal Farmers Club Federation. The PO was registered under 'Chhattisgarh Autonomous Cooperative Act, 1999', which allows the farmer groups to work as a business entity and earn profits. The PO is anchoring the programme of producing and marketing of certified seeds of paddy (five varieties), wheat, soybean, mustard, gram, arhar, mung and horse garm (tiwda). 1.10 During 2013-14, 39 members of the PO were registered with the Seed Certifying Authority of the State Govt. to produce certified seed (25 farmers in 153 ha. during Khariff and 14 farmers in 106 ha. during Rabi). The total production of certified seed by these members during the year was 656 MT in Khariff and 394 MT in Rabi. Total seed produced by these farmers were procured by the PO at a cost of Rs. 73.32 lakh. Subsidy is provided to seed farmers to encourage them to sell the seed to seed procurement institutions (and not in the mandis). Similarly, to encourage farmers to use certified seeds, the Government provides subsidy to seed processing institutions so that quality seed can be made available to farmers at a reasonable rate. For the year 2014-15, the PO has a programme to procure certified seed of about 2700 MT from its members. It has so far contracted seed-growing farmers for 380 ha. paddy for Khariff and 195 ha. paddy for Rabi.'"
2770,2998,"'1.11 The PO has established infrastructure facilities for cleaning, grading, packaging, certification and storage of certified seed. The seed is sold through the outlets of farmer federations, set up adjoining the BC Kiosks. The PO has found a niche market for its services among the farmers. The PO could capture the seed market to the extent of 30%. Still there exists large scope for expansion for the PO in the district.'"

2772,3000,"'1.12 As the farmers need an assurance from the PO for procurement of seeds and similarly the PO also has to have assured supply of seeds, PO provides advance to the farmers for inputs and consumption. NABARD provided financial assistance of Rs.1.943 crore (Rs. 1.85 crore as loan & Rs.9.43 lakh as grant) on 23 Sep 2013 to support the PO for on-lending to farmers. The loan assistance was for procurement of seeds, creation of infrastructure for cleaning, grading, packaging and storage, holding costs till seed is sold. The grant support was extended for capacity building and training, etc. As at the end of May 2014, loan amount of Rs. 1.74 crore was disbursed. Discussions with the office bearers of PO revealed that they plan to seek higher sanctions from NABARD for the enhanced business programme during 2014-15.'"

As far as possible the interest groups which have already been financed by a bank branch, may be considered for federating into one FPO. Thereafter, the POPI will focus on social mobilisation, awareness creation and motivating them to form FPO. A baseline survey will be conducted by POPI for bench marking, Training Need Assessment of the producers, assessing infrastructure requirements, market intervention and other support facilities/linkages necessary for the success of FPO. This will be followed by designing and organising capacity building programmes, preparation of business development plan for the FPOs, establishment and registration under appropriate Act, facilitation in credit and market linkages and extending hand-holding support towards maturity for a minimum period of 03 years.'"

POPI will mobilize at least 50 farmer membership under each FPO initially required for  economy of scale as envisaged in the proposal for formation/ registration of Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs). POPI will facilitate gradually increasing the membership over 3 years period to an optimal size (say, 500-1000 members) required for sustaining the business of FPO.  iii.    POPI will select blocks and villages for FPO promotion in consultation with the local  administration, State Govt., NABARD Regional Office and RSA.  iv.     POPI will ensure that the FPO promotion work is undertaken within the broad objectives/  framework of the operational guidelines issued by NABARD/ process guidelines issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India.   v.     POPI will deploy experienced and qualified manpower for the said task, which may be  supervised and guided by a dedicated staff of POPI.  vi.

2775,3001,"'1.13   The Certification Agency, Dept. of Agriculture, Government of Chhattisgarh (GoCG), registers the farmers cultivating seeds. The farmers have to submit application to the department with land documents and register themselves by paying fee of Rs. 300 per ha. The farmers clubs, federation and PO help the farmers in registration. The Department provides foundation seed to the farmers and also conducts field monitoring of the plots from time to time to ensure scrupulous adherence to package of practices for producing seed. Representatives of the certifying agency visit the field at least three times during a crop cycle; at the time of planting, at the flowering stage and at the time of harvest. This ensures that good quality seeds are produced.'"
2776,3002,"'1.14 After approval and certification, the PO packages the seed in 30 kg. bags, duly sealed. The seed is being marketed under the brand name \'Kisan Beej\'. The PO has the option to sell the certified seed directly to the farmers, Agriculture Department, PACS or Seed Corporation. In case the seed is not approved, it is sent to PACS for Government procurement, where the PO gets the amount as per the MSP. If the seed is approved, farmers get Rs. 2,090 per quintal (consisting of Rs. 1,310 MSP plus Rs. 450 production charges and Rs. 330 as bonus) for seed cultivation. Seed production subsidy and bonus to the farmers is routed through the PO. Similarly, for handling seed, the PO gets Government subsidy of Rs. 740 per quintal of seed (Rs. 50 for production, Rs. 500 for processing and distribution and Rs. 190 for storage). The expenditure involved by the PO was Rs.100 for transportation, Rs.450 for cleaning, grading, packaging and storage and interest on loan Rs.90, thus, the total was Rs. 650 per quintal. The net profit per quintal was Rs. 90 for the PO which is available for administration and other overheads. 1.15 The PO was using the Kiosks opened by the farmer federations as outlet points for selling seed. A commission of 4% was given by the PO to the federations on the sales. Transportation charges are presently borne by the PO. For the farmer federations which are operating Kiosks, it was an additional source of income, making kiosks financial viable. The PO is providing certified seeds to the farmers of farmer clubs at their door step and extending the much needed banking services to them.'"
2777,3003,"'1.16 The model of the PO with federations and farmer clubs at the ground level with Kiosks/outlets for inputs and services can be considered as sustainable for the following reasons:  a.  It is a farmer organization from top to bottom, providing essential services to the farming community. Hence, the acceptance level in the farming community is high.   b.  With renewed focus on financial inclusion, farmer clubs can act as BCs of banks, facilitated through their federations. This will ensure that farmers get both banking services and agricultural inputs and related information at one place.   c.  Production, processing and consumption of certified seed is carried out to meet the requirement of the farmers, creating readymade market locally.  The benefits to the farmers include timely availability of high quality seed at a reasonable cost.   d.  The State Government is channelizing its payments/subsidies under 7-8 schemes through these kiosks making them more popular among the farmers.   e.  The operating margin at the PO level is quite satisfactory. In its first year, it has surpassed the break-even level, even earning a little surplus. The State Government supported the farmers for cultivating seed and the PO for processing the seed. The demand for quality seed is more than what the farmers could produce at present.  Therefore, there is scope for growth. There is potential for the activity to become viable, even without subsidy.  f.  For the State Government, there is a farmer organization which is able to take care of the input needs of the farmers. State Government can converge some of its agricultural schemes through the PO/ farmer federation and reach the unreached. Agricultural extension services can be provided using this institutional arrangement at a lower cost to a large number of farmers.'"

(c) In case of new beneficiaries being uploaded on the PM-KISAN Portal, all land holding farmers' families who are Non-resident Indians (NRIs) in terms of the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 shall be excluded from any benefit under the Scheme. 4.2  For the purpose of exclusion State / UT Governments can certify the eligibility of the beneficiaries based on self declaration by the beneficiaries. In case beneficiary is not available / does not reside in the village, State / UT Governments may consider certification based on the declaration by other adult member of his / her family. In case of incorrect self declaration, beneficiary shall be liable for recovery of transferred financial benefit and other penal actions as per law.'"
2805,3039,"'5.1  The benefit shall be paid to only those farmers' families whose names are entered into the land records. Exception has, however, been made for North-East States and Jharkhand in this regard. 5.2  The cut-off date for determination of eligibility of beneficiaries under the scheme shall be 01.02.2019 and no changes thereafter shall be considered for eligibility of benefit under the scheme for next 5 years. However, this date is not applicable when transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death. 5.3  Benefit will be allowed in those cases where transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death of the landowner. However, those eligible farmers whose names have been entered in the land record after 01.12.2018 till 01.02.2019 shall be eligible for the benefits from the date of entry of land rights in the land records. In such cases where, transfer of ownership of cultivable land has happened due to any reason which could be purchase, succession, will, gift, etc., between 01.12.2018 and 31.01.2019, the installment pertaining to the 4-monthly period / trimester December, 2018 - March, 2019 during the financial year (2018-19) shall be proportionate amount from date of transfer till 31.03.2019 with respect to the 4 months period. 5.3.1 In cases where the land records have not been updated for rights accruing due to succession on account of the death of land owners before 01.12.2018, such updation of land records may be done by the States in a time bound manner.  The successors    whose names are entered in land records for rights accrued as aforementioned shall be eligible subject to fulfilment of other conditions of the Scheme and the exclusion clauses.'"

In such cases the family of the successors would be entitled to the  benefits, if otherwise eligible as per scheme guidelines.  ii)  In cases of cultivable land transferred to other persons through Sale Deed,  Partition Deed, Gift Deed, etc., the transferee will not be eligible under the Scheme as he / she was not the land owner as on 01.02.2019.  However, in such cases even the transferor of the land will become ineligible if the family of the transferor does not have any cultivable land subsequent to such a transfer.   5.3.4 The State Governments have to put in place the administrative mechanism based on their existing land revenue administrative regime to take care of formulations. There should be clear cut responsibility entrusted to the officials responsible for undertaking mutation of land records.   i)  In case of correction of land record for recording land ownership accrued  due to inheritance before 01.12.2018 then the eligibility of the family under the scheme shall be properly determined as per the conditions of the scheme. The procedure for determining the eligibility as per the exclusion clauses shall remain as prescribed.'"
2807,3041,"' ii)  In case of transfer of land ownership due to inheritance, reassessing the  eligibility of the family under PM-KISAN -  If the family is no longer eligible, then the same have to be updated in the PM-KISAN portal so that the benefits can be discontinued subsequently.  In case of family of the deceased land owner is still eligible (where spouse or the minor children are having cultivable land and eligible as per guidelines), the details of the new beneficiary alongwith other details with the fresh self-declarations have to be provided to the concerned authorities for inclusion / modifications so that the benefit to the survivors of the family can continue.  iii)  Subsequent to inheritance if the families of the inheritors also become  freshly eligible under PM-Kisan then all the details of the freshly eligible families have to be incorporated in the database so that benefits start accruing to such families from the date when inheritance became operational.  iv)  In case of transfer of cultivable land for reasons other than death after  01.02.2019, the officials have to reassess the eligibility of the transferor  and decide whether the benefits have to be stopped or not and intimate the authorities so that the PM-KISAN portal can be updated.  Transferees  are not entitled for any benefits under PM-KISAN in such cases.   5.4  The beneficiaries, whose names are uploaded on PM-Kisan Portal by the State /  UT Government in a particular 4-month period / trimester, shall be entitled to receive benefit for that trimester and for further installments pertaining to the subsequent trimesters for that financial year. 5.5  In some of the North Eastern States, the land ownership rights are community based and it might not be possible to assess the quantum of land holder farmers.'"
2808,3042,"'In such States an alternate implementation mechanism for eligibility of the farmers will be developed and approved by the Committee of Union Ministers of Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), the Ministry of Rural Development (Department of Land Resources), the Union Agriculture Minister and the concerned State Chief Ministers or their Ministerial representatives, based on the proposal by the concerned North Eastern States. 5.5.1 For identification of *bona fide* beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Manipur, the following proposal of Government of Manipur was considered and approved by the Committee: \'The certificate issued by the Village authority, namely, the Chairman/Chief, authorizing any tribal family to cultivate a piece of land, may be accepted. Such certification of village Chairman/Chief shall be authenticated by the concerned sub-divisional officers. All the exclusions under the Operational Guidelines will be applicable.\' 5.5.2 For identification of *bona fide* beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Nagaland, the following procedure was approved by the Committee:  1) In case of community owned cultivable land in the state of Nagaland which is  under permanent cultivation, for identification of beneficiaries under PM-KISAN, the certificate issued by the village council/authority/village chieftan  regarding land holding, duly verified by the administrative head of the circle/sub-division and countersigned by the Deputy Commissioner of the District shall suffice subject to  the exclusions under the operational guidelines.'"

This will facilitate farmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. State  Govt. and concerned Insurance Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions  etc.  2.4   Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender documents which will be followed by entry of bidded Premium rates and name of selected Insurance  Company immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order.  2.5   Since the National Crop Insurance Portal has been conceptualised for auto administration and seamless flow of data/information/reports on real time basis, State Govt. would not be allowed to  create/use separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes.   2.6    All Stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the    Portal for administration of the Scheme.

Accordingly the picking dates and number will be adjusted. For example, if the average picking date for second picking in a particular Taluka is in December and one experiment has shown first picking in December it will be considered as second picking.  18.3.8.5  If there is no proper CCE (with required number of pickings) in the  Taluka level even, it should be considered as no CCE being available and the procedure defined in yield dispute SOP (Standard  Operating Procedure) should be followed, i.e. yield should be estimated using remote sensing and  weather based models. In case the crop has withered and there is no further possibility of having further pickings the same shall be recorded compulsorily in the mobile application/ CCE-Agri App while  conducting the current picking experiment. In such cases, no multiplication factor may be used for  calculation of AY.   The Actual Yield Data at Crop-IU level shall be automatically synchronised with the Portal through online CCE mobile application. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the Portal, the same shall be verified and approved by the concerned District/State authorities.  For those experiments which were conducted offline/without mobile application, the Actual Yield data, along with the location information shall be uploaded by the concerned District administration or State nodal department on the Portal itself. This shall be an exception to be exercised in rare cases and CCEs should not exceed 5% of total CCEs. Actual Yield data through any other mode other than through National Crop Insurance Portal shall not be accepted. If yield data is not uploaded/ synchronised /approved within pre-defined cut-off date by the concerned authority/department, the concerned Insurance Company, may inform State Govt. /Central Govt. well in time for taking appropriate action.  18.3.8.6  Insurance Company should be given complete access to co-witness the CCEs, the digital images of the  CCEs and relevant data in the requisite format (electronic/physical) by the State Govt. on real time basis (Para 35.2.11). A schedule should be formally given/ shared with Insurance Companies  sufficiently in advance without fail to help them to coordinate with field functionaries and mobilize their manpower accordingly.  For this purpose, Insurance Company shall permanently station one  representative at the concerned dist office of the dept/ agency mandated to conduct CCEs for proper day to day liaison (Para 18.3.6).

3021,3258,"'However, wherever long-term satellite data is needed MODIS (250 m) data can be used, but it should  not be used for village level for information.  Ideally for deriving crop specific vegetation indices, crop maps should be overlaid on the data.  Generally for few major crops, crop maps are prepared under  FASAL project of DAC&FW. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote sensing (SAR) data of appropriate resolution.  Wherever, crop maps are not available, at least agricultural area map should be used. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest  2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.'"
3022,3259,"'Crop Growth Modelling:  Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such as  DSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi-physical modelling approach can also be used for crop growth analysis.  However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated models and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolution, at least 5 km.'"
3023,3260,"'Identification of Outliers: All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any reason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared.  The Yield proxy map can be derived from remote sensing vegetation indices (single or  combination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters, which are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc. Whatever, yield proxies to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record  documentary evidence (from their or other's published work) that the yield proxy is related to the particular crop's yield.  Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield proxy map. Both  yield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4-5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor, Very poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2 levels), the CCE yield for that IU can be considered, as outliers.'"
3024,3261,"'Computing Yield for the Outliers: For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield  may be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long-term  yield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote sensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated.  The final yield can be estimated as a combination of CCE Yield and model estimated. The weightage to be given to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or Model). Low weightage should be given to CCE not conducted properly (without photograph, geo location, proper sampling plan etc.). Similarly lower weightage to be given model estimates, if model is statistically not highly significant. Wherever, if the model was not statistically significant the average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may have specific and special cause related to a problem and may not be considered as a reference for any other case.) Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm rainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post-harvest stage has different impacts; a small amount rainfall having devastating wind-speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall having calm or no-wind. The Technical Agency needs to take into account all these factors to consider each of the cases as an individual and special case.     19.7.6   Time required for the analysis: The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned technical  agency, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State Government.  19.7.7  Funds needed for the analysis: All the analysis will be carried out by the Technical Agency, with its  existing resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may be funded by the concerned Insurance Agency or the State Government, whichever organization has  brought the dispute issue up to TAC.     19.7.8  General Suggestions: Though this SOP identifies the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in a long  run, it will benefit the scheme and the farmers, if there is no Dispute. Following suggestions are made  to avoid dispute.'"

3028,3265,"'20.1   To Rationalize CCEs: With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging  capability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products.  It has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference  Vegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the cropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health. This feature can be successfully used to target  the CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in 'smart sampling' (stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number of CCEs, to make them representative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce the total need of CCEs by about  30-40% while maintaining similar accuracy. It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it  will consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU and not just location of 4 CCEs.  States can adopt this technique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in generating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For  using satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under the FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25, para 25.4. These crop maps can be used for CCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to be computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized into poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be selected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these IUs can be done in order to develop crop yield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a reconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This can be done in consultation with MNCFC, NRSC (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department has also been piloting such  studies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology.  20.2   To remove Area Discrepancy in coverage: It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts,  area insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery, digitization of land records needs to be done  to minimize the area discrepancy. For this detailed  procedure has been laid down in section 25'"
3029,3266,"'20.3.1   For addressing the issue of reliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy, representativeness and  timeliness, innovative technologies such as satellite remote sensing, drone, modeling, AWS/ARG,  real  time transmission of data etc. should be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and  timely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international organizations, including MNCFC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the  use of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various stages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and support timely claim processing and payments.   20.3.2   States, with the support of national centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out  adequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mentioned  above, and small number of good quality CCEs. When a significant correlation is observed between remote sensing and weather estimated yield and yield estimated through CCEs, States and Insurance Companies can use these technologies in estimating the crop yields at IU level, subject to the satisfaction of both States and Insurance Companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to service the claims.'"
3030,3267,"'20.4.1   It has been observed that the normall CCE process being followed by the State for estimating yield is  lacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement.
